## Air-bnb CloneUsers can filter and search for available properties, view property details and submit a request to book a property. The client side app integrates with a Node.js mock API implemented in the `mock-server` folder.To launch Air-bnb Clone (and the mock API) run:- `npm install`- `npm start`Some of the tasks have unit tests associated with them. To run the unit tests run `npm test`. If you only want to run the tests for a specific task you can pass in the path to the test file. e.g. `npm test src/tests/filterUtil.test.js`.Created on Feb 2023
